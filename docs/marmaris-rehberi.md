# Marmaris & Southern Coasts Guide

Marmaris is the technical hub of our network and the gateway to the Hisarönü and Yeşilova gulfs.

## 1. Marmaris Central Marinas
*   **Netsel Marina (VHF 06):** In the heart of the city, next to the castle.
*   **Marmaris Yacht Marina (VHF 14):** Giant capacity and technical service center.
*   **Albatros Marina:** Boutique and quiet accommodation.

## 2. Bay Restaurants (Reservation Required)
This region is the most critical point of our "Booking.com" vision. Private restaurant piers dominate rather than large marinas.
*   **Selimiye:** Blue waters and boutique restaurant piers. (Watch out for shallows!)
*   **Bozburun:** Gulet building center and isolated docking areas.
*   **Söğüt (Octopus/Kalamar):** Gourmet seafood piers.

## 3. Navigational Warnings
*   **Dişibilmez Cape:** A point of strong wind and current crossing.
*   **VHF Coverage:** Satellite connection is recommended for communication with Ada in some bays due to mountainous terrain.
